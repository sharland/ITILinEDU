I'm a former computer science teacher in the UK.  I started this blog as my career path will likely be taking me toward technical support and in the modern commercial world this will include ITIL.  I therefore thought this blog would be a great way to start exploring the issue of ITIL.  Even if my career in tech support takes me far from education I thought one way to ground my understanding of ITIL would be to write about its techniques in relation to education.
